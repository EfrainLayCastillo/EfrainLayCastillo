### Hi, I'm Efra√≠n

#### I'm Software Engineer graduated from Technological University of Panama, based in Panam√° city.

I have worked as Web developer for +4 years creating, improving, migrating and managing web sites. I have been able to work with Heroku, deploying Ruby on Rails apps and storing assets on s3 as well as building and deploying Wordpress sites on EC2 and databases on RDS, also work with Lambda services with API Gateway to provide connection with static app using Jekyll, among others.

I'm a full-stack developer oriented to Backend, using React library or angular to build user interfaces, node.js or python to bring up the server to expose end-points services to provide connections and not less important, relational and no-relational Database such as Postgres and MongoDB to stored and data access. Besides I have worked with Agile methodologies more specifically Scrum and I have used Zoho Sprint to manage projects, also I always use source code managements like GitHub.
